# 🚢 Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to explore the data, clean it, visualize patterns, and extract meaningful insights about survival chances of passengers.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** → Data handling & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** → Visualization  
- **Seaborn** → Statistical visualizations  

---

## 📊 Key Explorations
- Dataset overview with `.info()` and `.describe()`  
- Handling missing values  
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis  
- Correlation between features using **heatmaps & pairplots**  
- Distribution of Age, Fare, and Passenger Classes  
- Survival analysis based on gender, age, class, and fare  

---

## 🔍 Insights & Findings
- **Gender:** Females had much higher survival chances compared to males.  
- **Class:** Higher-class passengers (1st class) had better survival rates than lower-class ones.  
- **Age:** Children had a slightly higher survival probability.  
- **Fare:** Passengers with higher ticket fares were more likely to survive.  
- **Embarkation Port:** Passengers embarking from certain ports had different survival distributions.

## 📥 Dataset Source
The dataset is taken from Kaggle:  
[Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This EDA helped uncover **patterns and relationships** in the Titanic dataset, showing how survival was influenced by socio-economic status, gender, and age.  
Such insights form the foundation for building predictive models later.
